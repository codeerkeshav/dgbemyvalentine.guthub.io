# Diksha will you be my valentine for life?


In the quiet glow of rosy light 🌹✨
Your smile turns my dark to bright 🌟😊
Like morning sun on fields of dew 🌅💫
My happiest dreams all start with you 💕🌈
Your laughter hums a sweet love tune 🎶💓
My heart beats like a bashful monsoon 🌧️💖
Kaddu you are so fine, will you be my valaentine? 💌🥰
